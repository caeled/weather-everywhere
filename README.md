# Weather Everywhere

A portable world-weather workshop for curious kids and adults. Ask, explore, connect.

## Start here

Open **index.html** in a modern browser. Copy the entire folder to a USB drive to carry the workshop. No installation, API key, map billing account, build step, or framework is required. JavaScript must be enabled.

On Windows, double-click **Launch.cmd**. It opens the workshop in your default browser. If live requests are blocked when opening local files, use **Serve.cmd** (requires Python 3 already installed), which serves only this folder on localhost:8002. Close its terminal window to stop the server.

## Explore

- **Map room:** bundled Natural Earth world geography, click any coordinate, pan/zoom, enlarged map, 16 named places, exact-coordinate input, three layers, °C/°F, and a month slider.
- **Compare places:** twelve-month illustrative temperature profiles, a readable table, and computed day length. These are teaching examples, not station climate normals. No invented profile is supplied for custom coordinates.
- **Antarctica expedition:** jump straight to coast versus South Pole in southern summer. Distinguish seasons from warmth and coast from high interior.
- **Look live:** current model conditions and seven-day model forecasts from Open-Meteo. Explicit source, retrieval time, valid time in UTC, cache labels, error handling, and save to notebook. No live request is sent until you click the button. Coordinates go to the provider; no location permissions are requested.
- **Ripple lab:** warm water, cold water, salinity, and wind; density, indirect heat transport, coastal response, moisture index, controlled playback, single steps, presets, and saved experiments.
- **Cloud maker:** temperature, humidity, mountain height, dew point, approximate cloud base, and parcel cooling.
- **Field missions:** nine curiosity-led challenges, no timers or scores.
- **Notebook:** notes and experiment evidence, local browser storage, JSON export/import, print layout. Export to carry notes to another browser or computer. Storage can be unavailable in local-file or private browsing modes.
- **Go deeper:** NOAA, BAS, NASA Worldview, global atmospheric maps, NWS radar, and source explanations.
- **Quiet skies:** removes automatic lab playback and smooth scrolling. OS reduced-motion settings enable this by default. Keyboard alternatives exist for map clicks; live and lab outcomes are shown as text.

## Offline and live

All core maps, profiles, simulations, missions, and code are local. Online-only links are clearly external. Live forecasts are best-effort: Open-Meteo's free endpoint is for non-commercial use and has limits and no uptime guarantee. Look live reuses a cached forecast for ten minutes; when a request fails, any older saved result is labeled **OFFLINE / SAVED SNAPSHOT** with its dates. It never substitutes an invented forecast.

For a trip with no internet, run **tools/Save-Forecasts.ps1** beforehand. It saves model forecasts for the built-in places into assets/snapshots.js. The workshop will use these only as dated cached snapshots. No helper downloads or runs third-party executables. The core package does not need large videos or downloads: research links open externally on demand.

## Science and limits

Read **SCIENCE.md** for equations, assumptions, source links, and dataset provenance. This is a teaching workshop, not an operational forecast or warning service. The small ocean lab cannot predict AMOC, climate-change thresholds, real rainfall, or a named city's weather. Consult official local weather services for warnings.

## Verify and package

With Node.js and Python installed:

```
node --test tests/science.test.cjs
python tests/check-package.py
```

To produce a fresh portable ZIP, run tools/Build-Package.ps1 or use Python's zipfile module on this folder, excluding .git. Development dependency: Node only for tests; no dependency for the workshop itself.

## Publish

This checkout can be hosted on any static host. Copy all files and preserve structure. GitHub Pages can use the main branch at the repository root.

**tools/Publish-GitHub.ps1** updates `caeled/weather-everywhere` using your existing Git login. It can adopt the remote history when run from a downloaded ZIP while preserving your working files. It does not change login or security settings. Review the destination in the script before running. Publishing the repository does not enable Pages hosting automatically.
